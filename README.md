# Cycle Solver

Cycle Solver provides an easy-to-use GUI for using the Ideal Gas Law for dry air and calculating quantities in Thermodynamic Cycles of dry air. Cycle Solver also provides plots of thermodynamic cycles.

## Bugs/Known Issues
* Plotting isothermal and adiabatic processes shows straight lines
* Input fields allow non-numeric inputs

## Future Updates
* Updating plotting for isothermal and adiabatic processes
* Restricting inputs to numeric inputs
* Adding moist air Ideal Gas Law and moist processes to cycles
