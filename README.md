# Cycle Solver

Cycle Solver provides an easy-to-use GUI for using the Ideal Gas Law for dry air and calculating quantities in Thermodynamic Cycles of dry air. Cycle Solver provides plots of thermodynamic cycles. Cycle Solver also includes an Adiabatic Solver which allows state calculations for adiabatic processes.

## Future Updates
* Automatically clearing non-numeric inputs from input fields
* Adding moist air Ideal Gas Law and moist processes to cycles
